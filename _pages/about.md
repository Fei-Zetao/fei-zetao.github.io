I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées, École Polytechnique, France, working with Prof. Josselin Garnier.

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), under the supervision of Prof. Hai Zhang.

My research interests include inverse problems and imaging, wave physics, and signal processing.
